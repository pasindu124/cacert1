---------------------------------

1. installed OpenSSL

   It will create your own CA. Your CA server's public key file is cacert.pem. It is in the sslCA directory. This public key has to be configured as trusted certificate in your application.

3. execute createHostCert.sh script. 
   Your Web server private key and certificate will be created. Your private keyfile is hostkey.pem and  certificate file is  hostcert.pem. You can point these files by editing the  htttpd-ssl.conf.

4. execute createUserCert.sh.

5. Digitally signed a Java applet
   This personal certificate can be used to signed Java applets by using the following command:
   jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore usr.pfx Your_Jar_File.jar mykey
